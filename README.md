# Rainfall Prediction Italy 2025
This project leverages machine learning to predict the probability of rainfall in Central Italy for every day of 2025. The model uses a logistic regression approach, trained on synthetic weather data generated to simulate typical climate conditions in Italy. The predictions include weather parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure to forecast whether it will rain on each day, along with the probability of rainfall. The repository also includes a CSV file with daily predictions and a graph showing the rain probabilities over the year.

Key features:

Logistic regression-based model trained on historical weather data.
Forecasts rain probabilities for each day of 2025.
CSV output with detailed weather parameters and predictions.
Visualization of rain probabilities across the year.
